Engineering geology is the application of geological principles and methods to engineering problems, such as site investigation, construction, design, and management of civil engineering projects. Engineering geology also deals with the study of natural hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, and floods, and their mitigation and prevention.

One of the most popular and useful books on engineering geology is *Engineering and General Geology* by Parbin Singh, published by S.K. Kataria and Sons. This book covers the basic concepts and topics of engineering geology, such as the structure and composition of the earth, geological processes and agents, rocks and minerals, structural features of rocks, physiographic features, economic mineral deposits, stratigraphy of India, engineering properties of rocks, groundwater, earthquakes, mass movements, soils, geological investigations, dams and reservoirs, tunnels and road cuts, and improvement of sites.
 
The book is written in a simple and lucid language, with numerous diagrams, illustrations, examples, and exercises. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of civil engineering, mining engineering, metallurgy engineering, geology, and allied disciplines. The book is also useful for practicing engineers, geologists, consultants, and professionals involved in civil engineering projects.
 
The book is available in PDF format online from various sources. However, it is recommended to buy the original book from the publisher or authorized dealers to support the author and get the latest edition. The book can be purchased from Amazon or other online platforms.
  
In this article, we will review some of the main topics and concepts covered in *Engineering and General Geology* by Parbin Singh. We will also provide some key points and tips for each topic.
 
## The Earth
 
The earth is the third planet from the sun and the only one known to support life. The earth has a spherical shape, but it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. The earth has a diameter of about 12,756 km and a circumference of about 40,075 km. The earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, creating day and night. The earth also revolves around the sun once every 365.25 days, creating seasons.
 
The earth is composed of three main layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core. The crust is the outermost layer of the earth, ranging from 5 to 70 km in thickness. The crust is divided into two types: continental crust and oceanic crust. The continental crust is thicker and less dense than the oceanic crust. The mantle is the middle layer of the earth, extending from the base of the crust to a depth of about 2900 km. The mantle is composed of hot and semi-solid rocks that undergo convection currents. The core is the innermost layer of the earth, consisting of two parts: the outer core and the inner core. The outer core is liquid and composed of iron and nickel. The inner core is solid and also composed of iron and nickel. The core generates the earth's magnetic field.

- The earth's shape is influenced by its rotation and gravity.
- The earth's layers have different physical and chemical properties.
- The earth's surface features are shaped by various internal and external forces.

## Geological Work of Natural Agencies
 
Natural agencies are the forces or agents that act on the earth's surface or subsurface, causing changes in its shape, structure, or composition. Some of the major natural agencies are weathering, erosion, transportation, deposition, diastrophism, volcanism, metamorphism, and sedimentation.
 
Weathering is the physical or chemical breakdown of rocks at or near the earth's surface. Weathering can be caused by factors such as temperature changes, water, wind, ice, plants, animals, and human activities. Weathering produces smaller fragments of rocks called sediments or soil.
 
Erosion is the removal or displacement of weathered materials by natural agents such as water, wind, ice, or gravity. Erosion can create features such as valleys, canyons, gorges, cliffs, and caves.
 
Transportation is the movement of eroded materials from one place to another by natural agents such as water, wind, ice, or gravity. Transportation can create features such as rivers, streams, deltas, beaches, dunes, glaciers, and moraines.
 
Deposition is the accumulation or settling of transported materials in a new location by natural agents such as water, wind, ice, or gravity. Deposition can create features such as alluvial fans, floodplains, sandbars, spits, lagoons, barsaati islands
