In Dungeons 3, you play as the Dungeon Lord, who has united the forces of evil under his command. You can build and customize your own dungeon, recruit and train various creatures and heroes, and unleash them on the overworld to conquer the lands of the good. You can also switch between the underworld and the overworld at any time, and control your units directly in a classic RTS mode.
 
Dungeons 3 has a campaign mode with 20 missions, each with a different objective and challenge. You can also play in a skirmish mode with randomly generated maps, or join forces with other players in a co-op or competitive multiplayer mode. The game also has a sandbox mode where you can create your own scenarios and maps.
 
One of the best features of Dungeons 3 is its humor and personality. The game is narrated by Thalya, a former good hero who has been corrupted by the Dungeon Lord and serves as his second-in-command. She often breaks the fourth wall and makes witty comments on your actions and the game world. The game also parodies various fantasy tropes and clichÃ©s, such as elves, dwarves, unicorns, and dragons.
 
Dungeons 3 is a game that will appeal to fans of strategy games, dungeon management games, and comedy games. It is available on Steam for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can also find it on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If you want to experience the ultimate dungeon management game, then don't miss Dungeons 3.

## Thalya: The Narrator and the Protagonist
 
One of the most unique aspects of Dungeons 3 is its narrator, Thalya. Thalya is a former good hero who has been corrupted by the Dungeon Lord and serves as his second-in-command. She is also the protagonist of the campaign mode, where she leads the evil army to conquer the overworld.
 
Thalya is not your typical evil character. She is sarcastic, cynical, and self-aware. She often breaks the fourth wall and makes fun of the game's mechanics, plot, and characters. She also has a conflicted personality, as she sometimes shows signs of remorse or doubt about her evil deeds. She also has a crush on the Dungeon Lord, who is never seen but only heard.
 
Thalya is voiced by Kira Buckland, who also voiced 2B in Nier: Automata and Reimi Sugimoto in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. She delivers her lines with a lot of emotion and humor, making Thalya one of the most memorable characters in the game.

## The Dungeon: Your Evil Lair
 
Another key feature of Dungeons 3 is the dungeon management aspect. You can build and customize your own dungeon, where you can recruit and train various creatures and heroes, and store your resources and treasures. You can also set traps and defenses to protect your dungeon from invaders.
 
The dungeon is divided into tiles, which you can dig and build on. You can also use spells to modify the terrain or affect the units. You have access to different rooms and buildings, such as the treasury, the workshop, the brewery, the arena, and more. Each room has a different function and effect on your units.
 
You can also recruit and train various creatures and heroes in your dungeon. You can choose from different factions, such as demons, undead, or horde. Each faction has its own strengths and weaknesses, and its own unique units. For example, the demons have powerful fire-based attacks, but are weak to ice. The undead have high health and can resurrect, but are slow and vulnerable to light. The horde have fast and agile units, but are fragile and chaotic.
 
You can also recruit heroes from the overworld, such as knights, mages, or archers. You can capture them in battle or lure them with gold. Once you have them in your dungeon, you can torture them to convert them to your side or sacrifice them for mana. You can also equip them with different items and weapons to improve their stats.
