# 500 Days of Summer: A Romantic Comedy with a Twist
 
500 Days of Summer is a 2009 movie that tells the story of Tom Hansen, a greeting card writer who falls in love with Summer Finn, his co-worker and the girl of his dreams. However, Summer does not share his feelings and does not believe in true love. The movie follows their ups and downs over the course of 500 days, as Tom tries to win her over and cope with their break-up.
 
The movie is not a typical romantic comedy, as it does not follow a linear narrative and does not have a happy ending. Instead, it explores the complexities and realities of modern relationships, using humor, music, and unconventional storytelling techniques. The movie also features an impressive cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom, Zooey Deschanel as Summer, and ChloÃ« Grace Moretz as Rachel, Tom's wise-beyond-her-years sister.
