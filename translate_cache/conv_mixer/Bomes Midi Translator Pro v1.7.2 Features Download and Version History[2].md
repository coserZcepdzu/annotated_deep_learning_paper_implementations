To create a translator, you need to specify the following parameters:

- The incoming trigger: this is the MIDI message that activates the translator. You can capture the incoming trigger from your MIDI device by clicking on the Capture button and playing the desired note or control.
- The outgoing action: this is the action that is performed when the translator is activated. You can choose from different types of actions, such as MIDI message, keystroke, mouse action, timer action, or execute file.
- The options: these are additional settings that modify the behavior of the translator. You can use variables, expressions, conditions, and functions to manipulate the incoming and outgoing data.

After you have created your translators, you can test them by playing your MIDI device and observing the results on your software application. You can also monitor the incoming and outgoing MIDI messages in the Log window. If you want to edit or delete your translators, you can do so by selecting them in the Preset list and clicking on the Edit or Delete buttons.
 
You can create as many presets and translators as you want in your project. You can also switch between presets using MIDI messages or keystrokes. You can save your project as a .bmtp file and load it later when you need it. You can also export your project as a .bmt file and run it with Bome's MIDI Translator Player, which is a standalone application that does not require installation or licensing.
